# Smart JobHunter

Smart JobHunter is an AI-powered job application tool that processes a candidate's resume to identify their target job category and location, retrieves matching job listings via the Adzuna API, and automatically submits applications using Selenium automation.


## Features

- **Resume Processing:**  
  Extracts text from a PDF resume using PyPDF2.
  
- **Job Category Determination:**  
  Determines the candidate's target field (e.g., Software Engineering, Data Science, Healthcare) by matching keywords in the resume.

- **Location Extraction:**  
  Reads a list of cities from an external file (`cities.txt`) and extracts the candidate's location from the resume text. If no match is found, it uses a default location ("New York").

- **Job Listing Retrieval:**  
  Retrieves live job listings from the Adzuna API based on the extracted job category and location.  
  *Note: You must set up your Adzuna API credentials.*

- **Job Matching:**  
  Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to rank job listings based on how closely each description matches the candidateâ€™s resume.

- **Application Submission:**  
  Automatically submits applications using Selenium.  
  The tool supports different submission flows for Indeed, LinkedIn Easy Apply, and a generic web form.  
  A progress bar shows the submission status, and results are updated with messages indicating success, failure, or any errors.
